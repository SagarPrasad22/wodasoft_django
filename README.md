## Django i18n support project

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

It is a Django based web application where multi language support is demonstrated using model

## Objective

- When Djangoâ€™s LANGUAGES parameter is updated (e.g. one more language is added/removed), a corresponding field must be added/removed automatically;
- Default language field must be required, it must not be allowed for a user to save any model without default language value specified;
- Dynamically add item and it's translations as JSON from Django admin
- Also, load initial item and it's translations as JSON using Django Fixtures

## Q&A

**Pros:**
- By bypassing Django's default i18n representation of locale lc message render where we have to write text translations on separate language po files, now we can store the text translations on model as JSON data which is more convenient and easy to use with Django Admin.


**Cons:**
- Adding text translations of different languages manually still a tedious task for the user.


**Improvements:**
- We can use python libraries like "Translate", by which we can translate any text to required languages automatically.
- So, that the user don't have to manually translate text and store it to database.
